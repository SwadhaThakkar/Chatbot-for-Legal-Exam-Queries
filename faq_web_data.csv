CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN LAW  (Click Here)
LAW, for a layman, means a system of rules and guidelines, legally enforceable. But as a profession, it means lot more and encompasses various fields such as litigation, media, advisory, academics, etc. As law incorporates diverse fields, it opens various options for law graduates. The demand for knowledgeable law graduates, with the requisite skills to handle key positions at leading organizations across diverse sectors, has surged dramatically.
With a growing economy and an increasing number of foreign firms targeting the Indian market, the requirements of legal expertise has not only increase but make LAW a very lucrative and respectable career option. Some options where you can make your career in Law are given below:-
1. LITIGATION / LITIGATOR
The traditional career path for a lawyer, is to ""go into practice"", or join the chambers of a senior advocate as his junior. The traditional image of a lawyer is based on this career option only but now, there is scope for specialization even in this field - some lawyers practice criminal law, some company law, some taxation, constitutional law, etc. You can choose to focus on appellate work, trial-level practice, tax consultant, civil litigation or criminal cases.
2. CORPORATE ADVISORY
You may work with a company/corporate entity as an in-house legal counsel, advising on legal matters related to its business. An In-house counsel plays an important role in drafting, scrutinizing and negotiating contracts; ensuring and monitoring compliance with rules and laws; and handling legal disputes.
Private Sector:
One may join Multi-National Corporations, Private companies, Private Banks, etc.
Public Sector:
Counsels are also required in Government Agencies, Public Sector Undertakings, Public and Nationalized banks, etc. These government organizations usually recruit lawyers through a written competitive exam followed by an interview.
3. LEGAL ANALYST in LAW FIRMS
Nowadays, a new trend has emerged where law graduates shifted from solo practice to well organized law firms, which comprise several lawyers working together as one entity. As part of a law firm, one advises clients about their legal rights as well as advise them on other legal matters and represents them in trials.
4. LEGAL PROCESS OUTSOURCING (LPO)
Legal Processing outsourcing (LPO) is the delegation of core legal functions like making first drafts of cases, compliance work, legal research, etc. by any MNC/Corporate to an External Consultancy firm called LPO. The assigned task is completed on the basis of set parameters and fixed timelines. You can become an important part of reputed MNCs by shaping a career in LPO.
5. RESEARCH & ACADEMICIA
Academics is the place where you are paid for sharing your knowledge with the young blood of the nation. There are many Law Schools in the country where thousands of students are pursuing their career in Law and for that they need some intellectual personalities who can work as a Guide, a Teacher and a Mentor for the students. This is a career that not only allows you to pursue your intellectual interests but also to work on Research Projects and also offers a wide degree of flexibility and autonomy and pays you to read, talk and think.
6. CAREER IN MEDIA AFTER LAW DEGREE
If you're curious and good at communicating, this one could be for you. As professions, both journalism and law are interconnected as they require superior research and writing skills as well as a critical knowledge of the government and the legal system.

The Contract should be performed by the promisor himself. However, in certain cases, it can also be performed by his agents or legal representatives. It all depends upon the intention of the parties. Normally a contract can be performed by the following persons.
Promisor himself: If from the nature of the contract it appears that it was the intention of the parties that the promise should be performed by the promisor himself, such promise must be performed by the promisor. This usually applies to contracts involving personal skill, task, or artwork.
Promisor or his Agent: Where the contract does not involve the personal skill of the promisor, the contract could be performed by the promisor himself or by any competent person employed by him for the purpose,
Legal Representatives: The contracts which do not involve any personal skill or taste, may be performed by his legal representative after the death of the promisor.

Section 43 of the Indian Contract Act further provides that unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, each joint promisor may compel every other joint promisor to contribute equally to the performance of the promise. If any joint promisor makes a default in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such default in equal shares.

Natural justice is another name for common sense justice rules of natural justice are not in codified form these principles are embedded or ingrained or inbuilt in the conscience of human beings. It supplies the omission made in codified law and helps in the administration of justice. Natural justice is not only confined to ‘fairness’ it will take many shades and colours based on the context. Thus natural justice apart from ‘fairness’ also implies reasonableness, equity and equality. They are neither cast in a rigid mould nor can they be put in a legal straitjacket. These principles written by nature in the heart of mankind, they are immutable, inviolable, and inalienable.
It is true that the concept of natural justice is not very clear and, therefore, it is not possible to define it; yet the principles of natural justice are accepted and enforced. In the case of Ridge V. Baldwin Court observed that “in modern times have sometimes been expressed to the effect that natural justice is as vague as to be practically meaningless. But I would regard these as tainted by the perennial fallacy that because something cannot be cut and dried or nicely weighed or measured therefore it does not exist”. The term natural justice signifies fundamental rules of judicial procedure and fair play in action. According to Lord Widgery “the principles of natural justice were those fundamental rules; the breach will prevent justice from being seen to be done”. Earliest expression of ‘natural justice’ could be found in the philosophical expression of Roman Jurist (jus natural) and signified rules and principles for the conduct of man which were independent of enacted law or customs and could be discovered by the rational intelligence of man and would grow out of and conform to his nature.
The rule against bias that surfaced in 1610 in Dr Bonham's Casewhere Chief Justice Coke went so far as to say that the Court could declare an Act of Parliament void if it made a man as judge in his own cause, or otherwise ‘against common right and reason’. This was one of his grounds for disallowing the claim of the College of Physicians to fine and imprison Doctor Bonham, a Doctor of Physics of Cambridge University, for practising in the city of London without the licence of College of Physicians. The statute under which the College acted provided that fines should go half to the King half to the College so that the College had a financial interest in its own judgement and was judged in its own cause.
Question:
X is a student of a college and his father Y is a professor in the same college. In one instance, X is caught to be involved in unparliamentary activities inside the college campus. The enquiry committee is set up and Y is appointed as the head of the committee. Decide.
Option: 1
Y is a professor of the same college hence he can become a member of the enquiry committee
Option: 2
Y is X’s father hence he should not be a part of the enquiry committee
Option: 3
Y can be a part of the enquiry committee but cannot be its head
Option: 4
There is no rule that prevents the appointment of Y until he fulfils his function diligently

The appeal will stand as X’s presence is a factor of bias
Option: 4
The appeal will be quashed since X was a renowned cricketer

It supplies the omission made in codified law and helps in the administration of justice. Natural justice is not only confined to ‘fairness’ it will take many shades and colours based on the context. Thus natural justice apart from ‘fairness’ also implies reasonableness, equity and equality. They are neither cast in a rigid mould nor can they be put in a legal straitjacket. These principles written by nature in the heart of mankind, they are immutable, inviolable, and inalienable.
It is true that the concept of natural justice is not very clear and, therefore, it is not possible to define it; yet the principles of natural justice are accepted and enforced. In the case of Ridge V. Baldwin Court observed that “in modern times have sometimes been expressed to the effect that natural justice is as vague as to be practically meaningless. But I would regard these as tainted by the perennial fallacy that because something cannot be cut and dried or nicely weighed or measured therefore it does not exist”. The term natural justice signifies fundamental rules of judicial procedure and fair play in action. According to Lord Widgery “the principles of natural justice were those fundamental rules; the breach will prevent justice from being seen to be done”. Earliest expression of ‘natural justice’ could be found in the philosophical expression of Roman Jurist (jus natural) and signified rules and principles for the conduct of man which were independent of enacted law or customs and could be discovered by the rational intelligence of man and would grow out of and conform to his nature.
The rule against bias that surfaced in 1610 in Dr Bonham's Casewhere Chief Justice Coke went so far as to say that the Court could declare an Act of Parliament void if it made a man as judge in his own cause, or otherwise ‘against common right and reason’. This was one of his grounds for disallowing the claim of the College of Physicians to fine and imprison Doctor Bonham, a Doctor of Physics of Cambridge University, for practising in the city of London without the licence of College of Physicians. The statute under which the College acted provided that fines should go half to the King half to the College so that the College had a financial interest in its own judgement and was judged in its own cause.

In the case of M/S Halonex Limited, 59-A Noida vs State of U.P., it was held that “In reply to the aforesaid submission, learned counsel for opposite party no.2 submitted that the case of the applicants that no amount is due from their side to the complainant is a matter of defence which cannot be considered at this stage. It has been submitted that the term 'entrustment' as used in Section 405 IPC has been given a wider interpretation. It has been submitted that the goods returned by the complainant to the Company for replacement or for reimbursement would be deemed to have been entrusted to the Company and as the applicants 2 & 3 were handling its affair they become responsible. To buttress the said submission, the learned counsel for the complainant drew the attention of the Court to a decision of the Apex Court in the case of Ram Narayan Popli Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation: (2003) 3 SCC 641, wherein it was observed that: ""the term ""entrustment"" is not necessarily a term of law. It may have different implications in different contexts. In its most general signification all it imports is the handing over possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary right at all."" Attention was also drawn to an observation made in the judgment of the aforesaid case, where it was observed that: ""to establish the charge of criminal breach of trust, the prosecution is not obliged to prove the precise mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which he has dominion. The principal ingredient of the offence being dishonest misappropriation or conversion which may not ordinarily be a matter of direct proof, entrustment of property and failure in breach of an obligation to account for the property entrusted if proved, may, in the light of other circumstances, justifiably lead to an inference of dishonest misappropriation or conversion”.

it is true that the concept of natural justice is not very clear and therefore it is not possible to define it yet the principles of natural justice are accepted and enforced in the case of ridge v baldwin court observed that in modern times have sometimes been expressed to the effect that natural justice is as vague as to be practically meaningless but i would regard these as tainted by the perennial fallacy that because something cannot be cut and dried or nicely weighed or measured therefore it does not exist the term natural justice signifies fundamental rules of judicial procedure and fair play in action according to lord widgery the principles of natural justice were those fundamental rules the breach will prevent justice from being seen to be done earliest expression of natural justice could be found in the philosophical expression of roman jurist jus natural and signified rules and principles for the conduct of man which were independent of enacted law or customs and could be discovered by the rational intelligence of man and would grow out of and conform to his nature

Frequently Asked Questions About CLAT
Posted by
Vidyut
October 4, 2024
With the growing number of aspirants, there are many questions that arise regarding the exam, its structure, and its preparation.
The National-level entrance exam for admissions into undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) law programs at
26 National Law Universities (NLUs)
in India.
It is one of the most sought-after exams for students aspiring to study law, with fierce competition for limited seats at top institutions.
1. What is CLAT, and why is it important?
The
Common Law Admission Test (CLAT)
is an entrance exam conducted annually for admission into undergraduate and postgraduate law programs at NLUs in India. The importance of CLAT stems from its role as the primary gateway to the most prestigious law schools in the country. It tests students on various skills such as reading comprehension, legal reasoning, general knowledge, and quantitative techniques. Scoring well in CLAT can secure a spot in one of the highly ranked NLUs, which opens doors to lucrative careers in law, be it in corporate firms, judicial services, litigation, or academics.
2. What is the eligibility criteria for CLAT?
The eligibility criteria differ for UG and PG programs:
For UG (CLAT-UG)
:
Candidates must have completed their
10+2
(or equivalent) from a recognized board.
General/OBC/PWD/NRI candidates must secure at least
45%
marks, while SC/ST candidates need
40%
marks.
Candidates appearing for the qualifying exam (10+2) in the same year can also apply, provided they meet the conditions at the time of admission.
For PG (CLAT-PG)
:
Applicants must hold an
LLB degree
or equivalent with a minimum of
50%
marks (45% for SC/ST candidates).
Final-year LLB students can also apply if they meet the eligibility criteria at the time of admission.
3. What is the exam pattern for CLAT?
The CLAT exam pattern is slightly different for UG and PG courses:
For CLAT-UG
: The test is a
2-hour
long paper consisting of
150 multiple-choice questions
(MCQs). The paper is divided into five sections:
English Language (28-32 questions)
Current Affairs including General Knowledge (35-39 questions)
Legal Reasoning (35-39 questions)
Logical Reasoning (28-32 questions)
Quantitative Techniques (13-17 questions)
Each question carries 1 mark, and
0.25 marks are deducted for every incorrect answer
.
For CLAT-PG
: The exam consists of
120 MCQs
based on comprehension passages from subjects like Constitutional Law, Jurisprudence, Torts, Criminal Law, International Law, etc. The paper lasts
2 hours
. Each correct answer is awarded 1 mark, with a penalty of 0.25 marks for wrong answers.
4. How can I prepare for CLAT effectively?
Effective CLAT preparation requires a blend of strategic planning, regular practice, and resourceful study techniques. Here are some tips:
Understand the syllabus
: Familiarize yourself with the exam pattern and syllabus, and break it down into manageable sections.
Make a study plan
: Create a personalized study schedule that ensures each section gets enough focus.
Read newspapers daily
: Current Affairs and Legal Reasoning sections demand that you stay updated on national and international news.
Take mock tests
: Regularly attempt full-length mock tests to get a feel for the actual exam. Analyze your performance and work on weak areas.
Practice comprehension
: For Legal Reasoning, English, and Logical Reasoning sections, build your reading comprehension skills by reading editorials, articles, and legal journals.
Revise consistently
: Make it a habit to revise key concepts and important topics frequently to retain information.
5. Is CLAT difficult to crack?
CLAT is a competitive exam, but whether it’s difficult or not depends on the individual’s preparation. With
effective time management
, a
strategic approach
, and consistent practice, it’s very possible to score well in CLAT. The key challenge is the intense competition, as only a small percentage of students get admission into the top NLUs. However, focusing on
accuracy
,
smart guessing
(due to negative marking), and thorough preparation can make a huge difference.
6. What are the best resources for CLAT preparation?
Choosing the right resources can make your preparation more effective. Some of the best resources include:
Books
:
“Word Power Made Easy” by Norman Lewis for vocabulary
“Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning” by RS Aggarwal
“Lucent’s General Knowledge” for static GK
CLAT past year papers and mock tests
Websites
:
CLAT online coaching platforms like Vidhigya and others provide regular mock tests and study materials.
Online GK portals and apps like
The Hindu
,
GK Today
, and
BYJU’s
offer reliable current affairs coverage.
YouTube Channels
:
Vidhigya’s
YouTube channel
has videos related to exam strategies, section-wise preparation tips, and legal reasoning.
7. What is the role of mock tests in CLAT preparation?
Mock tests play an essential role in CLAT preparation as they help you:
Simulate real exam conditions
: Taking timed mock tests helps build your stamina for the actual exam day.
Identify strengths and weaknesses
: Analyzing your mock test results will show which areas need improvement and which sections are your strengths.
Improve time management
: With 150 questions to answer in 2 hours, effective time management is critical. Mock tests help in refining your speed and accuracy.
Boost confidence
: Regular mock testing and familiarity with the exam format reduce anxiety and boost your confidence.
8. Is it necessary to join a coaching institute to crack CLAT?
No, it’s not mandatory to join a coaching institute to crack CLAT. Many students have cleared the exam through
self-study
, using the right resources, and a disciplined approach. However, coaching institutes can provide structure, guidance, and additional resources. It depends on your personal learning style. If you need a systematic approach with regular classes and peer competition, coaching may be helpful. If you’re self-motivated and can create your own study plan, self-study with online resources can be equally effective.
9. How is the CLAT score calculated?
The CLAT score is calculated based on the number of correct answers and negative marking for incorrect answers. For every correct answer, 1 mark is awarded, and for every incorrect answer,
0.25 marks
are deducted. The final score is the sum of your correct answers minus the penalty for wrong ones.
10. When is the best time to start preparing for CLAT?
It’s ideal to start preparing for CLAT in
Class 11
or
Class 12
. This gives you ample time to understand the syllabus, develop the necessary skills, and take enough practice tests before the actual exam. However, students who start later can still succeed with intensive preparation, especially if they are disciplined and strategic in their study plan.
11. What are the top NLUs participating in CLAT?
Some of the top National Law Universities that accept CLAT scores include:
National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bangalore
National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (NALSAR), Hyderabad
National Law University (NLU), Delhi
The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (WBNUJS), Kolkata
National Law University (NLU), Jodhpur
Each NLU has its own cutoff, and students aim for top ranks to secure admission in these premier institutions.
12. What is the cutoff for CLAT?
The
cutoff for CLAT
varies from year to year, depending on factors like the difficulty level of the exam, the number of candidates, and the availability of seats. Generally, the cutoff for top NLUs is higher, and candidates need to rank within the top
100-200
to secure a spot in prestigious universities like NLSIU, NALSAR, or WBNUJS.
Conclusion
Understanding the basics of CLAT through these FAQs can help you navigate your preparation with clarity and confidence. Whether you’re wondering about the exam pattern, the best resources, or how to manage your time effectively
